# groffstudio: An IDE for groff.

You know what was missing with `groff`? A good alternative to TeXstudio. Here we go.

## Features

* Written in Lazarus (Free Pascal).
  * Should be cross-platform.
  * Successfully tested on Windows 10, macOS and Linux.
* Can produce PS and PDF files.
  * On Windows, creating PDF files requires [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) for the time being. On other systems, [i]groff[/i] should be able to just do it.
* Can handle some macros.

## License

`groffstudio` is free software under the terms of the CDDL-1.1. Feel free to help me with development. I'll happily grant you access to the upstream repository if you are good.

## Donations

Writing this software and keeping it available is eating some of the time which most people would spend with their friends. Naturally, I absolutely accept financial compensation.
